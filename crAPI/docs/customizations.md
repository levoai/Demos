# Customizing crAPI

## White Labeling
If you want to white label crAPI to suit your own brand, you can do so by setting the below environment variable prior to building crAPI Web.

The below environment variable white labels the app to `My Car Concierge`.

```bash
export REACT_APP_NAME="My Car Concierge"
```
